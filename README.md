May need to install dependencies
  - See video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j55fHUJqtyw&list=PLillGF-RfqbYSx-Ab1xWVanGKtowTsnNm&index=1
  
start server from root with 
  - npm run dev
  
Start client by cd into client folder then
  - npm run serve
  
still more steps to deploy like connecting to heroku.
