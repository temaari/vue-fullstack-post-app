Vue full stack post app which uses axios, express, mondoDB, cors, body-parser and nodemon.

May need to install dependencies
  - See video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j55fHUJqtyw&list=PLillGF-RfqbYSx-Ab1xWVanGKtowTsnNm&index=1
  
start server from root with 
  - npm run dev
  
Start client by cd into client folder then
  - npm run serve
  
still more steps to deploy like connecting to heroku.


to use as a default server for any application, pull this repo then remove everything but the server folder. You may need the vue.config.js file from client folder for proxy but once you just have the server folder. you can also remove teh public folder in server folder and build the project once ready to generate a new updated public folder.
